title: Simulation of DC-DC Power Converter using Physics-Informed Neural Networks
description: 
    The real-time simulation of power converters is necessary for the health monitoring and
    preventative maintenance to avoid critical failures. Developed a digital twin of a buck converter for simulation and health monitoring to be
    deployed on FPGA with a 1ns time-step.

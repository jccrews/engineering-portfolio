name: Clay Crews
headline: MS in Computer Engineering @ UofSC | Graduating August, 2025
description: >- # dont remove this line. this will ignore all new lines until the next section
  My interests / involvements include research in ML architecture, the development of digital twins (DTs), and real-time
  hardware deployment. I am currently working on my MS thesis on creating specialized solvers for accelerating the simulation
  of power electronic converters using physics-informed neural networks and real-time deployment on FPGA hardware. This
  research is in line with my work on Digital Twins for Naval Power and Energy Systems (NPES).

  I am seeking a position that is in need of research/development regarding Digital Twin systems and/or 
  implementation of machine learning on real-time systems.
